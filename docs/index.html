               <h3 id="whatis">What is Modernizr?</h3>

               <p>Modernizr is a small JavaScript library that <em>detects</em> the availability of native implementations for next-generation web technologies, i.e. features that stem from the HTML5 and CSS3 specifications. Many of these features are already implemented in at least one major browser (most of them in two or more), and what Modernizr does is, very simply, tell you whether the current browser has this feature natively implemented or not.</p>

               <p>Unlike with the traditional—but highly unreliable—method of doing “<abbr title="User Agent">UA</abbr> sniffing,” which is detecting a browser by its (user-configurable) <code>navigator.userAgent</code> property, Modernizr does actual feature detection to reliably discern what the various browsers can and cannot do. After all, the same rendering engine may not necessarily support the same things, and some users change their userAgent string to get around poorly developed websites that don’t let them through otherwise.</p>

               <p>Modernizr aims to bring an end to the UA sniffing practice. Using feature detection is a <em>more reliable</em> mechanic to establish what you can and cannot do in the current browser, and Modernizr makes it convenient for you in a variety of ways:</p>
            </div>

            <ol>
               <li>It tests for over 40 next-generation features, all in a matter of milliseconds</li>
               <li>It creates a JavaScript object (named <code>Modernizr</code>) that contains the results of these tests as boolean properties</li>
               <li>It adds classes to the <code>html</code> element that explain precisely what features are and are <strong>not</strong> natively supported</li>
               <li>It provides a script loader so you can pull in <a href="https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/wiki/HTML5-Cross-browser-Polyfills">polyfills</a> to backfill functionality in old browsers</li>
            </ol>

            <p>With this knowledge that Modernizr gives you, you can take advantage of these new features in the browsers that can render or utilize them, and still have easy <em>and reliable</em> means of controlling the situation for the browsers that cannot.</p>



            <h3 id="installing">Installing Modernizr</h3>

            <p>Head over to the <a href="/download/">Download</a> page, and select which features you intend to use in your project. This way we can provide the slimmest bits of code that you’ll need. Hit Generate and you’ve got your own custom build of Modernizr. If you don’t know yet what features you’ll be using, get the <a href="/downloads/modernizr.js">Development version</a> which contains them all, but is uncompressed.</p>

            <p>Drop the script tags in the <code>&lt;head></code> of your HTML. For best performance, you should have them follow after your stylesheet references. The reason we recommend placing Modernizr in the head is two-fold: the HTML5 Shiv (that enables HTML5 elements in IE) must execute before the <code>&lt;body></code>, and if you’re using any of the CSS classes that Modernizr adds, you’ll want to prevent a <abbr title="flash of unstyled content">FOUC</abbr>.</p>

            <p><small>If you don't support IE8 and don't need to worry about FOUC, feel free to include modernizr.js whereever.</small></p>


            <h3 id="polyfills">Polyfills and Modernizr</h3>

            <p>The name “Modernizr” might throw you for a second, we’ll admit. The library does allow you to use the new HTML5 sectioning elements in IE, but aside from that, it doesn’t <em>modernize</em> any other features. The name Modernizr actually stems from the goal of modernizing our development practices (and ourselves). However! Modernizr still pairs extremely well with scripts that do provide support when native browser support is lacking. In general, these scripts are called polyfills.</p>

            <blockquote>polyfill <em>(n)</em>: a JavaScript shim that replicates the standard API for older browsers</blockquote>

            <p>So a websocket polyfill would create a <code>window.WebSocket</code> global with the same properties and methods on it as a native implementation. That means you can develop for the future, with the real API, and only load your compatibility polyfills on browsers that do not support that API or feature.</p>

            <p>And good news for you, <strong><a href="https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/wiki/HTML5-Cross-browser-Polyfills">there is a polyfill for nearly every HTML5 feature that Modernizr detects</a></strong>. Yup. So in most cases, you can use a HTML5 or CSS3 feature and be able to replicate it in non-supporting browsers. Yes, not only can you use HTML5 today, but you can use it in the past, too!</p>

            <p>But that leads to a big, fat warning: <strong>just because you can use a polyfill doesn’t mean you should</strong>. You want to deliver the best user experience possible, which means it should be quick! Loading five compatibility scripts for IE7 so it looks and works the exact same as Chrome and Opera isn't a wise choice. There are no hard and fast rules, but keep in mind how adding more scripts to the page can impact the user experience. And remember, none of your users view your site in more than one browser; It’s okay if it looks and acts differently.</p>

            <p>Now for more on how to effectively use and serve polyfills for all your different users, read on…</p>





            <h3 id="load">Modernizr.load() tutorial</h3>

            <p><code>Modernizr.load</code> is a resource loader (CSS and JavaScript) that was made to specifically to work side-by-side with Modernizr. It’s optional in your build, but if you are loading polyfills, There’s a good chance it can save you some bandwidth and boost performance a bit.</p>

            <p><code>Modernizr.load</code> syntax is generally very easy to understand, so we’ll start with a basic example:</p>
<pre>
Modernizr.load({
  test: Modernizr.geolocation,
  yep : 'geo.js',
  nope: 'geo-polyfill.js'
});
</pre>

            <p>In this example, we decided that we should load a different script depending on whether geolocation is supported in the host browser or not. By doing this, you save users from having to download code that their browser does not need. This increases page performance, and offers a clear place to build a healthy amount of abstraction to your <a href="https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/wiki/HTML5-Cross-browser-Polyfills">polyfills</a> (both 'geo.js' and 'geo-polyfill.js' would seem the same to the rest of the app, even if they're implemented differently).</p>

            <p>There’s a good chance that you’re not terribly unhappy with your script downloading speeds now, but you’ll be happy to know that <code>Modernizr.load</code> does not slow anything down, and can sometimes offer a small boost in performance by loading scripts asynchronously and in parallel. There’s a lot of variables to weigh in this area, so we suggest that you try a few things to make sure you’re getting maximum performance for your specific situation.</p>

            <p><code>Modernizr.load</code> is small and simple, but it can do quite a bit of heavy-lifting for you. Here is a slightly more complicated example of using <code>Modernizr.load</code> when your scripts rely on more than one Modernizr feature-test. A good technique is to wrap up multiple polyfill scripts into a single 'oldbrowser' type script, that way you don’t end up loading too many scripts at once. Here's how that might work:</p>

<pre>
<span class="comment">// Give Modernizr.load a string, an object, or an array of strings and objects</span>
Modernizr.load([
  <span class="comment">// Presentational polyfills</span>
  {
    <span class="comment">// Logical list of things we would normally need</span>
    test : Modernizr.fontface &amp;&amp; Modernizr.canvas &amp;&amp; Modernizr.cssgradients,
    <span class="comment">// Modernizr.load loads css and javascript by default</span>
    nope : ['presentational-polyfill.js', 'presentational.css']
  },
  <span class="comment">// Functional polyfills</span>
  {
    <span class="comment">// This just has to be truthy</span>
    test : Modernizr.websockets &amp;&amp; window.JSON,
    <span class="comment">// socket-io.js and json2.js</span>
    nope : 'functional-polyfills.js',
    <span class="comment">// You can also give arrays of resources to load.</span>
    both : [ 'app.js', 'extra.js' ],
    complete : function () {
      <span class="comment">// Run this after everything in this group has downloaded
      // and executed, as well everything in all previous groups</span>
      myApp.init();
    }
  },
  <span class="comment">// Run your analytics after you've already kicked off all the rest
  // of your app.</span>
  'post-analytics.js'
]);
</pre>

            <p>There’s a lot that you can do with <code>Modernizr.load</code>. It was released standalone as <a href="http://yepnopejs.com/">yepnope.js</a> but it was made specifically with Modernizr and feature-testing in mind. You can check out the full docs for <code>Modernizr.load</code> at <a href="http://yepnopejs.com/">yepnopejs.com</a>.</p>

            <p>One cool feature of <code>Modernizr.load</code> is it’s complete decoupling of load and execution of scripts. That might not mean much to you, but users of the HTML5 Boilerplate might be familiar with the Google CDN copy of jQuery fallback. It looks something like this:</p>

<pre>
    &lt;script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.js">&lt;/script>
    &lt;script>window.jQuery || document.write('&lt;script src="js/libs/jquery-1.7.1.min.js">\x3C/script>')&lt;/script>
</pre>
            <p>It works by trying to load in the script, and then immediately after, testing to see if the jQuery object is available. If It’s not, then they load a local copy of jQuery as a fallback. This is generally not that easy in script-loaders, but <code>Modernizr.load</code> has got you covered. You can just use the same logic, and <code>Modernizr.load</code> will handle the execution order for you:</p>

<pre>
Modernizr.load([
  {
    load: '//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.js',
    complete: function () {
      if ( !window.jQuery ) {
            Modernizr.load('js/libs/jquery-1.7.1.min.js');
      }
    }
  },
  {
    <span class="comment">// This will wait for the fallback to load and
    // execute if it needs to.</span>
    load: 'needs-jQuery.js'
  }
]);
</pre>

            <p>A quick note, though: only use this technique as a method for fallbacks, because it can hurt performance by forcing scripts to load in serial instead of in parallel.</p>

            <p><code>Modernizr.load</code> is extensible as well. You can load your own prefixes and filters for your scripts. For more advanced information on that, you can check out the docs on the <a href="http://yepnopejs.com">yepnopejs.com homepage</a>. You can even go as far as to replace entire steps of the loading process and replace them with custom logic. So start using it and saving those precious, precious bytes.</p>







            <h3 id="howitworks">How Modernizr works</h3>

            <p>For a lot of the tests, Modernizr does its “magic” by creating an element, setting a specific style instruction on that element and then immediately retrieving it. Browsers that understand the instruction will return something sensible; browsers that don’t understand it will return nothing or “undefined”.</p>

            <p>Many tests in the documentation come with a small code sample to illustrate how you could use that specific test in your web development workflow. Actual use cases come in many more varieties, though. The possible uses of Modernizr are limited only by your imagination.</p>

            <p>If you’re really interested in the details of how Modernizr works, look at the <a href="https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/">source code</a> of modernizr.js and the various feature detects, and <a href="https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/issues">dig into the project on github</a>.</p>


            <h3 id="html5inie">HTML 5 elements in <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr></h3>
            <p>Modernizr runs through a little loop in JavaScript to enable the various elements from HTML5 (as well as <code>abbr</code>) for styling in Internet Explorer. Note that this does not mean it suddenly makes IE support the Audio or Video element, it just means that you can use <code>section</code> instead of <code>div</code> and style them in CSS. you’ll also probably want to set many of these elements to <code>display:block</code>; see <a href="https://github.com/paulirish/html5-boilerplate/blob/362d0b7/css/style.css#L35-37">the HTML5 Boilerplate CSS</a> for an example. As of Modernizr 1.5, this script is identical to what is used in the popular html5shim/html5shiv library. Both also enable printability of HTML5 elements in IE6-8, though you might want to try out the performance hit if you have over 100kb of css.</p>



            <h3 id="support">Supported browsers</h3>
            <p>We support IE6+, Firefox 3.5+, Opera 9.6+, Safari 2+, Chrome. On mobile, we support iOS's mobile Safari, Android's WebKit browser, Opera Mobile, Firefox Mobile and whilst we’re still doing more testing we believe we support Blackberry 6+.</p>

If you did not find a test you're looking for on this page here, try there or the <a href="https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/issues?labels=port+to+plugin&sort=created&direction=desc&state=open&page=1">issue tracker</a>.


            <h2 id="s25">Modernizr Methods</h2>

            <p>There is a pair of methods available, giving you some added functionality you’ll probably enjoy if you do a lot of CSS3 and responsive design.</p>

               <h3>Modernizr.prefixed()</h3>

                  <dd><code>Modernizr.<strong>prefixed(str)</strong></code></dd>
               </dl>

               <p>Modernizr.prefixed() returns the prefixed or nonprefixed property name variant of your input</p>

               <pre>Modernizr.prefixed('boxSizing') <span class="comment">// 'MozBoxSizing'</span></pre>


               <p>Properties must be passed as DOM-style camelCase, rather than `box-sizing` hyphenated style.</p>
               <p>Return values will also be the camelCase variant, if you need to translate that to hyphenated style use:</p>

               <pre>str.replace(/([A-Z])/g, function(str,m1){ return '-' + m1.toLowerCase(); }).replace(/^ms-/,'-ms-');</pre>

               <p>If you’re trying to ascertain which transition end event to bind to, you might do something like...</p>
<pre>
var transEndEventNames = {
    'WebkitTransition' : 'webkitTransitionEnd',
    'MozTransition'    : 'transitionend',
    'OTransition'      : 'oTransitionEnd',

<span class="comment">// ... bind to the transEndEventName event... </span>

               <dl id="prefixeddom">

                  <dd><code>Modernizr.<strong>prefixed(str, obj<i>[, scope]</i>)</strong></code></dd>
               </dl>

               <p>You can use <code>Modernizr.prefixed</code> to find prefixed DOM properties and methods easily. For example:

               <pre>Modernizr.prefixed('requestAnimationFrame', window) <span class="comment">// fn</span></pre>

               <p>By passing a second argument, you declare you are looking for a prefixed method or property on that object. If it finds something, but isn't a function, it'll return the object, boolean, number or value that it finds. For example, the quota management API: <code>Modernizr.prefixed('StorageInfo', window) <span class="comment">// object</span></code>.

               <p>If it finds a function, it'll return a bound function. By default the function will be <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind">bound</a> to the second argument. But you can change that by declaring a third argument that it should be bound to.</p>

<pre>
<span class="comment">// basic use</span>
Modernizr.prefixed('requestAnimationFrame', window) <span class="comment">// fn</span>

<span class="comment">// creating a rAF polyfill</span>
window.rAF = Modernizr.prefixed('requestAnimationFrame', window) || function(){ <span class="comment">... </span>

<span class="comment">// passing a scope</span>
var ms = Modernizr.prefixed("matchesSelector", HTMLElement.prototype, document.body)
ms('body') <span class="comment">// true </span>
</pre>

               <p>Lastly, if you want to search for a prefixed DOM feature and only want the name of it back, pass <code>false</code> as the 3rd argument:

<pre>
Modernizr.prefixed('requestAnimationFrame', window, false) <span class="comment">// 'webkitRequestAnimationFrame'</span>
</pre>

<p>If you want more, <a href="https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/issues/478">read our github ticket for this feature</a>. Also, we included a <code>Function.prototype.bind</code> polyfill in Modernizr 2.5 by default. It supports this feature, but you're welcome to use it in your app code, as well.</p>

               <p>Modernizr.mq tests a given media query, live against the current state of the window</p>
               <p>A few important notes:</p>

               <ul>
                  <li>If a browser does not support media queries at all (eg. oldIE) the mq() will always return false</li>
                  <li>A max-width or orientation query will be evaluated against the current state, which may change later.</li>
                  <li>You should specify the media type, though commonly the <code>all</code> type is good enough:
                      <pre>Modernizr.mq('only all and (max-width: 400px)')</pre></li>
                  <li>You must specify values. Eg. If you are testing support for the min-width media query use:
                     <pre>Modernizr.mq('(min-width: 0px)')</pre></li>
               </ul>

               <p>Sample usage:</p>
               <pre>Modernizr.mq('only screen and (max-width: 768px)') <span class="comment"> // true</span></pre>

            <h3 id="s3">Extensibility</h3>

            <p>The tests in Modernizr core may not cover all your cases, but there is a full set of APIs available for you to plug your own feature tests into Modernizr. Additionally, many of them have been collected already in the <a href="https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/tree/master/feature-detects"><code>/feature-detects/</code></a> folder and in <a href="https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/wiki">the wiki</a>.</p>

            <section class="test" id="addtest">
               <h3>addTest() Plugin API</h3>
               <dl>
                  <dt>JavaScript method:</dt>
                  <dd><code>Modernizr.<strong>addTest(str, fn)</strong></code></dd>

                  <dd><code>Modernizr.<strong>addTest({str: bool, str2: fn})</strong></code></dd>
               </dl>
               <p>You may want to test additional features that Modernizr currently does not support. For that, you can use the addTest function. For example, some users have requested tests for IE's float double margin bug, and support for <code>position:fixed</code>. All the current tests that we've codified are <a href="https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/tree/master/feature-detects">available in the Github</a>. Using addTest, you can add these yourself and get the exact same API as the fully supported tests.</p>
               <p>New signatures for this method of accepting a boolean or an object were added for Modernizr 2</p>

               <h4>Sample Usage:</h4>
               <pre><span class="comment">// Test for &lt;track> element  support</span>

               <p>Assuming the above test passes, there will now be a <code>.track</code> class on the HTML element and <code>Modernizr.track</code> will be true. IE6, of course, will now have a <code>.no-track</code> class.</p>

               </dl>

               <p>Modernizr.testStyles() allows you to add custom styles to the document and test an element afterwards. An element with the id of "modernizr" is injected into the page.</p>

<pre>
  Modernizr.testStyles('#modernizr { width: 9px; color: papayawhip; }', function(elem, rule){
      Modernizr.addTest('width', elem.offsetWidth == 9);
  });
</pre>

              <p>If your test requires more than a single element to be injected you can specify the <code>nodes</code> argument which accepts a number indicating how many extra child div elements you want injected inside the main element. These extra elements will default to and id of "modernizr[n]" where n is a number. If you wish to specify a specific id the <code>tesnames</code> argument allows you to pass an array of id's to apply to the child elements.</p>

<pre>
  Modernizr.testStyles('#modernizr { width: 9px; color: papayawhip; }', function(elem, rule){
      Modernizr.addTest('width', elem.offsetWidth == 9);
  }, 2, ["video", "image"]);

                  <p>The vendor prefixes you’ll have to test against. Look in the modernizr source or below to see how to effectively <code>join()</code> these arrays in order to test your style properties.</p>
